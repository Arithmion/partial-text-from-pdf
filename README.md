Just a simple ChatGPT assisted attempt at extracting text from only certain pages of a pdf.

This was an experiment with ChatGPT, CDNs, pdfjs, text extraction, and the dialog html element. It is aesthetically hideous and contains very little validation. I suggest you do not use this in production without extreme caution and knowledge of how to protect yourself from code injection, XSS, etc.

This project is not being actively maintained, and I will most likely ignore any issues or requests, as it was mostly an educational project. Feel free to fork it though! :)
